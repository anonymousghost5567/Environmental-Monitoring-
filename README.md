# Environmental-Monitoring-
This project is an Embedded System for Environmental Monitoring using an LPC1768 microcontroller. It continuously monitors air quality and provides real-time feedback through an LCD display and buzzer alerts. It is designed to alert users based on the Air Quality Index (AQI) and supports mode switching for multiple AQI views.
